# customer-intention-prediction-mlp
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to purchase a product based on their behavior, demographics, and interaction patterns. Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, the model performs binary classification (purchase vs. no purchase) to help businesses improve targeted marketing, customer retention, and sales forecasting.
